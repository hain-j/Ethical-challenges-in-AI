## Key Points

## Future Outlook
- Experts predict that by 2040, AI could potentially replace human developers in writing code, as AI systems become more advanced in machine learning, natural language processing, and code generation
- However, this shift is expected to be gradual, with human oversight remaining crucial in the foreseeable future.
### Adapting to Change:
- Developers are encouraged to embrace AI as a tool that augments their capabilties rather than replaces them.
- Continous learning and adaptation to new AI technologies are essential for staying relevant
#### How will AI ethics affect software developers in the next 5-10 years?
### AI Integration in Development:
- AI is becoming a part of software development to make it easier for programmers by taking over their tasks.
- Tools like GitHub Copilot and OpenAI codex assist developers by Suggesting code snippers and automating repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity.
- ### Evolving Developers Roles:
- While AI handles more routine coding tasks, developers are shifting towards roles that require higher-level thinking such as system archtecture, problem solving and ethical consideration in AI development
